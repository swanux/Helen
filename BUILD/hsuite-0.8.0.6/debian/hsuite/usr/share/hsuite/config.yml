# Example config for fusuma by Swanux

swipe:                              # name of the action
  3:                                # number of fingers used
    left:                           # direction of the gesture
      command: 'xdotool key send Ctrl+Alt+Right'
    right:
      command: 'xdotool key send Ctrl+Alt+Left'
    up:
      command: 'xdotool key send Ctrl+Alt+Down'
    down:
      command: 'xdotool key send Ctrl+Alt+Up'
  4:
    up:
      command: 'xdotool key send Super+Up' # super = Windows key
    down:
      command: 'xdotool key send Super+Down'
    left:
      command: 'xdotool key send Super+Left'
    right:
      command: 'xdotool key send Super+Right'
pinch:
  in:
    command: 'xdotool key super+a'
    threshold: 0.1
  out:
     command: 'xdotool key super'
     threshold: 0.1

threshold:
  swipe: 1
  pinch: 1

interval:
  swipe: 1
  pinch: 1


#if command: properties are blank, the swipe/pinch doesn't execute command.

#threshold: is sensitivity to swipe/pinch. Default value is 1. If the swipe's threshold is 0.5, shorten swipe-length by half.

#interval: is delay between swipes/pinches. Default value is 1. If the swipe's interval is 0.5, shorten swipe-interval by half to recognize a next swipe.

## For Wayland I know only this tool (https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool), however if you'd like to use it for gestures it is a security concern (because of given permissions). Here is another solution which is limited, but works well: https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma-plugin-wmctrl
