"0 A.D.\n"
"\n"
"The best strategic game for Linux (in my opinion)\n"
"\n"
"0 A.D. (pronounced \"zero ey-dee\") is a free, open-source, cross-platform "
"real-time strategy (RTS) game of ancient warfare. In short, it is a "
"historically-based war/economy game that allows players to relive or rewrite "
"the history of Western civilizations, focusing on the years between 500 B.C. "
"and 500 A.D. The project is highly ambitious, involving state-of-the-art 3D "
"graphics, detailed artwork, sound, and a flexible and powerful custom-built "
"game engine.\n"
"\n"
"It also supports online and LAN multiplayer, custom map creation, adding "
"mods to the game and if you would like to take part in the development you "
"can do that also.\n"

"Arch Linux\n"

"Arch Linux is a Linux distribution for computers based on x86-64 "

"blobs, hence the distribution is not endorsed by the GNU project.\n"
"\n"
"The design approach of the development team follows the KISS principle "
"(\"keep it simple, stupid\") as the general guideline. It focuses on "
"elegance, code correctness, minimalism, simplicity, and expects the user to "
"be willing to make some effort to understand the system's operation. A "
"package manager written specifically for Arch Linux, pacman, is used to "
"install, remove and update software packages.\n"
