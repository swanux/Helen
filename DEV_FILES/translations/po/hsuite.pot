"\n"
"The best strategic game for Linux (in my opinion)\n"
"\n"
"0 A.D. (pronounced \"zero ey-dee\") is a free, open-source, cross-platform "
"real-time strategy (RTS) game of ancient warfare. In short, it is a "
"historically-based war/economy game that allows players to relive or rewrite "
"the history of Western civilizations, focusing on the years between 500 B.C. "
"and 500 A.D. The project is highly ambitious, involving state-of-the-art 3D "
"graphics, detailed artwork, sound, and a flexible and powerful custom-built "
"game engine.\n"
"\n"
"It also supports online and LAN multiplayer, custom map creation, adding "
"mods to the game and if you would like to take part in the development you "
"can do that also.\n"

"Timeshift for Linux is an application that provides functionality similar to "

"Timeshift protects your system by taking incremental snapshots of the file "
"system at regular intervals. These snapshots can be restored at a later date "
"to undo all changes to the system.\n"
"\n"
"In RSYNC mode, snapshots are taken using rsync and hard-links. Common files "
"are shared between snapshots which saves disk space. Each snapshot is a full "
"system backup that can be browsed with a file manager.\n"
"\n"
"In BTRFS mode, snapshots are taken using the in-built features of the BTRFS "
"filesystem. BTRFS snapshots are supported only on BTRFS systems having an "
"Ubuntu-type subvolume layout (with @ and @home subvolumes).\n"
"\n"
"Timeshift is similar to applications like rsnapshot, BackInTime and "
"TimeVault but with different goals. It is designed to protect only system "
"files and settings. User files such as documents, pictures and music are "
"excluded. This ensures that your files remains unchanged when you restore "
"your system to an earlier date.\n"
